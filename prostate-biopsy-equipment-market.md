<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Prostate Biopsy Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>TRUS (trans-rectal ultrasound)</li><li>TPBX (trans-perineal)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The prostate biopsy equipment market features two primary types: TRUS (trans-rectal ultrasound) and TPBX (trans-perineal biopsy). TRUS utilizes ultrasound guidance through the rectum to precisely locate and extract tissue samples from the prostate, making it a widely used method due to its minimally invasive nature. TPBX, on the other hand, involves accessing the prostate through the perineum, providing a direct approach and often yielding higher-quality samples. Both techniques serve critical roles in diagnosing prostate conditions, influencing market demand and technological advancements.</p></p>
